# sql-challenge


This project  was to create a database to organize employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard( a fictitious company). Once the database was created, queries were performed to gain insights into the data.

To perform these actions, PostgreSQL was employed, in conjunction with pgAdmin.

## Steps to create Database and Load Data
1. First, a new database was created in pgAdmin, named Employees_db.

2. Next, the basic outline of the database tables was sketched using an entity relationship diagram. To do this, an ERD Drawing tool was used. This diagram can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder and seen below.
